 ----------------   THROW VS THROWS --------------



throws keyword is used to document a method might throw that type of exception
public static void playWithFire throws GetBurnedException{
    // some code here
}
this is the only place you will see throws keywrod
in (any) method declareation and is not used anywhere else.
we will not use new keyword after throws
Since throws are used to document it might throw an exception
can i documemnt more than one type?
// assuming these exceptions actually exists
public void skyDiving() throws DiveTooDeepException, TooScareException,
                                ParachuteNotWorkingException {
                                }
throw keyword
Its used to actually programaitically throw the exception to the runtime system
just like actually breaking the glass rather than telling it might break
for example :  throw new AnyTypeOfException( optional message here) .
    What can you throw ?????
    ANYTHING IS-A Throwable ,
    any object created from Throwable class or Sub class of Throwable class
    even the Error (DO NOT TRY AT HOME!!!!!)

    Throws is you might get exception !! used with ckeched Expections
    Throw you getting an exception !!    used with unchecked Expections
